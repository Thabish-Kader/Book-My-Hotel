## Next Js, Typescript, Google Maps API

### Lesson Learned

-   Prop Drilling: I knew what prop drilling was but this project really allowed me to get an idea on how it impedes performance and how to overcome this problem. I had an option to use redux or context api. I chose context api as it was a more reasonable option in this case because it was just a simple data from an api without needing to be modified. I would choose redux for a more complext data.

### Problems Faced

-   At the time of implementaion of the map componenet i quickly realized that i began prop drilling in order to tackle this i implemented the Context hook from react.
